1. For registration page
    email
    password
    first_name
    last_name
    type (student/teacher/admin) //admin account will already be created
    class (only if type is student)
    phone_no
    gender
    active (true/false) //initially false, admin can set to true and again false

2. Try to integrate Redux and test login and Register page (use the ref folder as reference)
